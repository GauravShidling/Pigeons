## Phase 1 Basic Web Development
### Frontend:
Design a basic layout with HTML and CSS.
Use JavaScript to add interactivity (forms for surveys, file upload buttons).
### Backend:

Set up a Flask/Django backend.
Create basic routes <br>
(e.g., /survey, /upload-image, /dashboard).
### Database:

Set up a simple SQLite database to store user information, activity logs, and suggestions.


## Phase 2: Core Features Implementation
### Activity Tracking:

Create a daily survey form (using HTML/JS).<br>
Store user inputs in the database.<br>
Write Python logic to calculate carbon footprint based on survey answers.
### Trash Analysis:

Train or use a pretrained model to classify trash images.<br>
Implement an image upload feature using Flask/Django.<br>
Process images and return suggestions (e.g., "Recycle this plastic bottle").


## Phase 3: Advanced Features
### Visualization:
Add charts to show carbon footprint trends using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js. <br>
### Suggestions Module:
Use AI to provide personalized recommendations based on user activity and waste.<br>
### Authentication:
Enable user login and profile management (use libraries like Flask-Login or Djangoâ€™s auth system).


## Phase 4: Deployment
Host your website using platforms like Heroku or Vercel.<br>
Use AWS S3 or Cloudinary for image storage.<br>
Test the site on multiple devices and gather feedback.
